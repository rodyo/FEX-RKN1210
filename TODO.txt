OutputFcn behaves differently from that of ode45 
Check whether p+2 for the stepsize adjustment is indeed correct!
add support for string functions with feval/varargin{:}
create custom deval() which extends built-in version
Strategy for dense output should be different; first, large steps should be made, which are then used as stepping stones to start new integrations from; this improves accuracy.
Check throw - rethrow logic
