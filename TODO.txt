NEW: 
- add support for string functions with feval/varargin{:}

- adjust DEMO to check Hamiltonian (compare to symplectic method) 
- functionalize Output/Event functions 
- port to C 

CHANGE: 
- OutputFcn behaves differently from that of ode45 

- create custom deval() which extends built-in version

- Strategy for dense output should be different; use the interpolating polynomials 

- Also use the dense routine for event location 
- implement custom odextend()
