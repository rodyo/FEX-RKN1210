2014/June/05 (Rody Oldenhuis)
- CHANGED: step adjustment now also considers RelTol (which might be more stringent            than AbsTol)
- FIXED: minor adjustments to allow for settings like AbsTol = inf


2014/June/04 (Rody Oldenhuis)
- FIXED: incorrect initial stepsize was selected in recursive calls (dense 
         output)
- FIXED: The power used in stepsize control should be based on the method's 
         order, PLUS 2 for embedded p/q pairs with |p-q|=2. So, not 1/12, 
         but 1/14.


2014/June/03 (Rody Oldenhuis)
- FIXED: error estimates turned NaN (divide-by-zero) when f turned all zero


2014/February/14 (Rody Oldenhuis)-
- CHANGED: included "Authors" field, donation link.
- NEW: implemented support for deval(). Note that MATLAB built-in deval()
       does not support rkn1210; a customized version is in the making.


2013/November/05 (Rody Oldenhuis)
- Found & fixed bug in handling of event functions
- Found & fixed bug in nitegrating in negative direction
- Corrected & improved error handling 
- Replaced narginchk() with a simple assert, and replaced tildes to supress output 
  argument with dummy variable names; this decreases MATLAB version requirements 
  to R2008a
- Array growth is now by a constant fraction of the current size; this 
  improves performance and has better memory complexity properties
    

2013/June/11 (Rody Oldenhuis)
- Set 'InitialStep' to previous step on recursive calls to RKN1210


2013/June/07 (Rody Oldenhuis)
- Added value of the second derivative for succesful steps to the output structure
- No memory is assigned for output variables when no output arguments are requested       
- Removed all support for funtions defined be string; only function handles 
- Added a few more checks on user inputs
- Updated elementary example
- Minor stylistic changes
